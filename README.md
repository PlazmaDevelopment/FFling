# FFling
Version 1.0.0

## Welcome to FFLING!

What is FFling?

FFling is a very basic language allowing everyone to create cli-based applications! User-friendly syntax and more cool features such as built-in package manager.

## Using FFling allows you:

* Create applications with ease
* Train yourself for other languages
* Be ready for any application you want to make!

You can also publish your packages allowing other users to install it. 

* Create a GitHub repo.
* Upload your files.
* Make sure your repo is public.

That's it! Now you have a ready to use published package. Now if other users wants to use your package they need to do these steps:

* Open the FFling terminal from 'terminal.bat'
* Type ":install package_name repo_link"

That's it! In the "package" directory they can see the packages or even use terminal commands to check installed packages!

## Code usage

```ffling

local a = 10
```

Local is a keyword allows users to store a value.

```ffling

local a = 10
printline(a)
```

In this example we used our variable "a" and printed it to the terminal.

```ffling

local a = 10
printline(a)

func myfunc():
  printline("a =", a)

myfunc()
```

Functions! With functions you can organize your code. Very simple isn't it?

```ffling

local a = 10
printline(a)

func myfunc():
  printline("a =", a)

myfunc()

if (a < 11):
  printline("a < 11")
else:
  printline("a > 11")
```

If/Else statements allowing you to take control of decisions! 

## Is that it?

Of course not! "for, while, true/false, inputline(), range, or, not, pass etc." are also in the language. For the last... Let's talk about inputs!

```ffling
local name = inputline()
printline("Your name is: ", name)
```

## Is language good enough?

Yes! It's amazing in some ways. Just start coding with FFling and see!
